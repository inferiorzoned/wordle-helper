# How to Run

Go to solver directory

Run the wordle_solver.py file

Run testSolver(word) to run (simulate) against a given word

Run runSolver() to run against a hidden word (actual wordle game)

Change debugMode from config.py to 0 (no info print), or 1 (additional info print)

Toggle dictionaryMode to True in the solver to see the dictionary meaning of the words (if the word exists in the dictionaryAPI)
